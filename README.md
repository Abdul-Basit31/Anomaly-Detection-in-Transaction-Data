# Anomaly Detection in Transaction Data

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in financial transaction data using machine learning algorithms. Anomalies, or outliers, are data points that deviate significantly from the rest of the dataset, often indicating potential fraud or data errors.

The solution leverages advanced machine learning techniques and can be applied to various datasets involving financial transactions. The primary goal is to identify suspicious transactions that may warrant further investigation.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw transaction data.
- Anomaly Detection Models: Implementing algorithms like Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and more.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization: Displaying outliers and anomalies for better interpretability.
